📊 Financial Performance Analysis of TechnoEdge | Power BI

This project presents an in-depth Financial Performance Analysis of TechnoEdge using Power BI. The primary goal is to assess the company’s financial health, analyze sales trends, identify operational challenges, and generate actionable insights that support effective business decision-making.

The analysis investigates multiple financial indicators, including Sales, Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), Profit, Discount impact, Country-wise revenue distribution, Customer Segment performance, and Product-wise sales trends. These metrics help understand profitability, efficiency, and growth opportunities within the organization.

Project Objective

The project aims to:

Evaluate overall financial performance using dynamic Power BI dashboards

Identify factors affecting profitability and revenue fluctuations

Understand customer and regional sales behavior

Recommend strategic improvements for long-term growth

Dataset & Methodology

The dataset consists of financial transaction data spread across four Excel files, including Finance Sales, Calendar, Transaction Details, and Dates. The data was cleaned and transformed using Power Query, and a well-structured star schema model was developed. DAX measures were created to calculate key metrics such as Total Sales, Total COGS, Total Profit, Profit Margin, and Discount Influence.

Dashboard Insights

Key findings from the analysis include:

Total Sales: 49.11M

Total COGS: 40M

Total Profit: 8.63M

Top Segment: Government

Top Product: Paseo

Top Country: Germany

The analysis shows that although revenue is growing, profit margins remain restricted due to high COGS and excessive discount rates. Sales heavily depend on the Small Business segment, posing business risk. Low discount categories contribute most to total revenue, indicating a need to minimize high discount strategies. Market distribution shows growth opportunities in regions with lower penetration.

Conclusion

The project reveals that TechnoEdge must strengthen pricing strategies, diversify its customer base, and expand into new markets to achieve sustainable financial stability. Optimizing product and operational costs and focusing on profitable customer segments will enable long-term growth and improved competitiveness.
